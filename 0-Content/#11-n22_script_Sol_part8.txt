GROUP FUNCTION   

-------------------
-------------------- 
  COUNT(*) 

connect scott/tiger

Ex1:  Write a query to display the number of rows in table emp

    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM   emp;

  COUNT (name_of_column)
Return the number of NOT NULL value in the specified column
Ex2:  Write a query to display the number of employee who earn
a commission

   sol:  
         SELECT COUNT(comm)
         FROM   emp;

SELECT empno, ename, sal, comm
FROM  emp;

Ex3:  Write a query to display the number of employee who 
DO NOT earn a commission

  SELECT COUNT(*) - COUNT(comm)
  FROM   emp;

  SELECT COUNT(empno) - COUNT(comm)
  FROM   emp;

  SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM   emp
  WHERE  comm IS NULL;
-----------------------
MIN (name_of_column) / MAX (name_of_column)/AVG (name_of_column)
SUM (name_of_column)
Return the Maximum/Minimum/Average/Sum of the specified column

Ex4:  Display the Maximum/Minimum/Average/Sum of salary of
all employees.

  SELECT MAX(sal), MIN(sal) , AVG(sal) , SUM(sal)
  FROM   emp;

Ex5:  Display the Maximum/Minimum/Average/Sum of salary of
all employees of EACH department (hint: use GROUP BY)

SELECT deptno , MAX(sal), MIN(sal) , AVG(sal) , SUM(sal)
  FROM   emp
GROUP BY deptno;

Ex6:  Display the Maximum/Minimum/Average/Sum of salary of
all employees of EACH job (hint: use GROUP BY)

SELECT job , MAX(sal), MIN(sal) , AVG(sal) , SUM(sal)
  FROM   emp
GROUP BY job;

Ex7:  Display the Maximum/Minimum/Average/Sum of salary of
all employees of EACH job of EACH department (hint: use GROUP BY)

SELECT job , deptno, MAX(sal), MIN(sal) , AVG(sal) , SUM(sal)
  FROM   emp
GROUP BY job, deptno
ORDER BY deptno;

Ex8:  Display the Maximum/Minimum/Average/Sum of salary of
all employees of EACH job Except the job 
PRESIDENT(hint: use GROUP BY)

SELECT job, MAX(sal), MIN(sal) , AVG(sal) , SUM(sal)
  FROM   emp
WHERE job <> 'PRESIDENT'
GROUP BY job;

Ex8:  Display the Maximum/Minimum/Average/Sum of salary of
all employees of EACH department Except the job 
PRESIDENT OR MANAGER(hint: use GROUP BY)

SELECT deptno, MAX(sal), MIN(sal) , AVG(sal) , SUM(sal)
  FROM   emp
WHERE job NOT IN('PRESIDENT', 'MANAGER') 
GROUP BY deptno;


Ex9:  Display the Maximum/Minimum/Average/Sum of salary of
all employees of EACH department Except the job 
PRESIDENT OR MANAGER AND the MINIMUM salary MUST
be greater than 1000


SELECT deptno, MAX(sal), MIN(sal) , AVG(sal) , SUM(sal)
  FROM   emp
WHERE job NOT IN('PRESIDENT', 'MANAGER') 
GROUP BY deptno
HAVING MIN(sal) > 1000;






Ex10:  Display the Maximum/Minimum/Average/Sum of salary of
all employees of EACH department Except the job 
PRESIDENT OR MANAGER AND the SUM of the salary MUST
be greater than 2000(hint: use HAVING)

SELECT deptno, MAX(sal), MIN(sal) , AVG(sal) , SUM(sal)
  FROM   emp
WHERE job NOT IN('PRESIDENT', 'MANAGER') 
GROUP BY deptno
HAVING SUM(sal) > 2000;
