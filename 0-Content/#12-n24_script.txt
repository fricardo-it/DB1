  SUB - QUERY 

Syntax:
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM   table1
    WHERE  columnx = (SELECT column3
                      FROM   table2
                      WHERE  columny = (SELECT column4
                                        FROM   table3
                                        WHERE   ...                );


Ex1:  Find all students who are in the same class as Amanda Mobley

   -- bottom up
   -- Find the class of Amanda Mobley

   SELECT s_class
   FROM   student
   WHERE  s_first = 'Amanda' AND s_last = 'Mobley';  SO

   -- Find all students of class 'SO'
   SELECT s_first, s_last
   FROM   student
   WHERE  s_class = 'SO';
==
   SELECT s_first, s_last
   FROM   student
   WHERE  s_class = (SELECT s_class
                     FROM   student
                     WHERE  s_first = 'Amanda' AND s_last = 'Mobley');


-- TOP DOWN
  SELECT s_first, s_last
  FROM   student
  WHERE  s_class = (SELECT s_class
                    FROM  student
                    WHERE  s_first = 'Amanda' AND s_last = 'Mobley');

Ex2: Modify the query of Ex1 to remove Amanda Mobley from the result.

SELECT s_first, s_last
  FROM   student
  WHERE  s_class = (SELECT s_class
                    FROM  student
                    WHERE  s_first = 'Amanda' AND s_last = 'Mobley')
  AND NOT (s_first = 'Amanda' AND s_last = 'Mobley');

Ex3: Find all students who are avised by the same advisor as Sarah Miller
--  bottom up
-- find the advisor of Sarah Miller

-- find the students with f_id = 1
   SELECT s_first, s_last

   WHERE  f_id = 1;
==
   SELECT s_first, s_last

                  FROM   student
                  WHERE  s_first = 'Sarah' AND s_last = 'Miller');

Remove Sarah Miller from the result

Remove Amada Mobley
SELECT s_id, s_first, s_last
